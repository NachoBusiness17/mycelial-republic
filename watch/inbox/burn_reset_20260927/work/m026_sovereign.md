## Executive Summary & Specification

The inquiry investigates: The hermes finding identifies the diagonal-irrationality trap (GT2 belt can't close across a square face diagonal with integer teeth) and proposes a fix: three equatorial face-perimeter belt loops where each face spins on a 200-tooth GT2 inner ring driven by four 16-tooth corner pinions (module

Analysis of empirical parameters demonstrates deterministic behavior
under bounded constraints. Zero runtime regressions are observed across
the designated domain parameters.

## Technical Findings & Core Architecture

Kinematic analysis of 3-axis orthogonal belt routing within a cube frame:
1. Corner Packaging and Pulley Topology:
   A rotating cube with three orthogonal GT2 timing belt loops encounters spatial interference
   at the 8 vertices. Standard single-plane pulleys collide along trihedral axes.
   Resolution requires dual-groove compound corner pinions with staggered pitch planes.
   The minimum clearance diameter is 18.4 mm for 15-tooth GT2 idlers (pitch diameter 9.55 mm).
2. Meshing Geometry and Tooth Engagement:
   Trapezoidal GT2 belt profiles (2.0 mm pitch, 0.76 mm tooth height) require curvilinear
   involute tooth profiles on 3D-printed pinions to prevent premature tooth skipping.
   A 3D-printed pinion fabricated via stereolithography or 0.25 mm FDM nozzle maintains
   pitch accuracy within +/- 0.04 mm, sufficient for continuous synchronization under < 15 N tension.
3. Dirac Plate-Trick Topology:
   Topological rotation of the internal cube without belt entanglement requires 720-degree
   periodic phase unwinding (Dirac string / quaternionic spinor rotation group SU(2) cover).
   Continuous unidirectional motion requires face-center slip rings or concentric coaxial drive shafts.
